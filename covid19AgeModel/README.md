# covid19AgeModel: COVID19 contact and infection model of the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the contact-and-infection model of the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team, which is an extension of the Bayesian semi-mechanistic model of [Flaxman et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7).

The model and associated Bayesian analysis via [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) have been used in

## System Requirements
- macOS or UNIX, the code was developed on macOS Mojave 10.14
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version >= 3.6.1
- [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) version >= 2.23. To allow for multi-threading, please add the necessary flags: 
1. On a Linux machine:
```bash
$ cd cmdstan_dir
$ echo "CXXFLAGS += -DSTAN_THREADS" > make/local
$ echo "CXXFLAGS += -pthread" >> make/local
```
2. On a Macintosh machine
```bash
$ cd cmdstan_dir
$ echo "CXXFLAGS += -DSTAN_THREADS" > make/local
```
where ```cmdstan_dir``` is where cmdstan has been installed. Then you can check your make file with
```bash
$ cat make/local
```


## Installation 
The code is structured as an R package. A ```yml``` file is provided and can be used to build a conda virtual environment containing all R dependencies. Create the environment using:
```bash
$ cd covid19AgeModel
$ conda env create -f covid19AgeModel.yml
```
Then activate the environment for use:
```bash
$ source activate covid19AgeModel
```
Then build and install the R package with
```bash
$ cd ..
$ R CMD build covid19AgeModel
$ R CMD INSTALL covid19AgeModel_x.y-z.tar.gz
```

## Usage
### Overview
To run the age-specific COVID-19 analysis on the US data, you need to 
* first run an R script, which generates a series of bash scripts; 
* each bash script corresponds to fitting the contact-and-infection model to the data via one Hameltonian Monte Carlo chain with Stan; 
* by default, we typically run 8 HMC chains in parallel, though 2 or 4 can also be specified;
* the bash scripts need to be executed in a UNIX environment.

### Package versions
* Results of the most recent analysis can be reproduced using the package version 1.2.0, 
* Results of Imperial Report 32 v2 can be reproduced using the package version 1.1.0
* Results of Imperial Report 32 v1 can be reproduced using the package version 1.0.0

<summary> Reproduce results of the final revision for publication (package version 1.2.0) </summary>
	
## Usage: example analysis for 4 states, 2 HMC chains
We provide a demo analysis that can be run on a laptop. The following modifications need to be done to the start of the R script
```bash
covid19AgeModel/inst/make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-v120-demo-bash.R
```
First, set the directory to where ```cmdstan``` has been installed to, as well as the output directory, and the directory in which the ```html``` summary are stored:
```R
cmdstan_dir <- '~/sandbox/cmdstan-2.23.0'
out_dir <- '~/sandbox'
report_dir <- '~/sandbox'
```
Second, set the number of HMC chains that are to be run in parallel. We advise to run 2 chains for the demo, but more can be run as long as the number of HMC iterations below are adjusted:
```R
hmc_chains_n <- 2
```
Third, set the variable ```hpc.nproc.cmdstan``` which specifies how many CPU cores are used to generate one HMC chain. We recommend to use 4 for the demo:
```R
hpc.nproc.cmdstan <- 4
```
Fourth, set the number of HMC warmup step and total number of HMC iterations. The default choice is: 
```R
hmc_num_samples= 1500
hmc_num_warmup= 1000
```
Fifth, specify the Stan model that you wish to use, and a job tag that may contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. By default the Stan model is set to that used in the final version for publication:
```R
stanModelFile= 'covid19AgeModel_v120_cmdstanv'
```
Lastly, the demo analysis is performed for 4 locations: Colorado, Connecticut, Florida and New York City. The selected locations can be changed using:
```R
countries <-  "CO,CT,FL,NYC"
```
Please be careful not to leave spaces between commas and location's abbreviations.

Then, run the Rscript from the terminal console
```bash
$ cd covid19AgeModel/inst
$ Rscript make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-v120-demo-bash.R
```
This will generate in the specified output directory one bash script for each HMC chain and the post-processing scripts. Execute these bash script one by one, or alternatively run them in the background,
```bash
$ cd out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag
$ ./startme-stanModelFile-job_tag-hmc1.sh 
```
When all the chains are finished, run the postprocessing with, 
```
$ ./out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag/post_processing_save_posterior_samples.sh
```
The HMC samples, figures and tables are stored in one folder:
```
out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag
```
An html report summarising the results of the central analysis is stored under:
```
report_dir/report_stanModelFile-job_tag.html
```

## Usage: full analysis, 40 states 8 HMC chains (as in the final version for publication)
The following modifications need to be done to the start of the R script
```bash
covid19AgeModel/inst/make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-v120-bash.R
```
First, set the directory to where ```cmdstan``` has been installed to, as well as the output directory, and the directory in which the ```html``` summary are stored:
```R
cmdstan_dir <- '~/sandbox/cmdstan-2.23.0'
out_dir <- '~/sandbox'
report_dir <- '~/sandbox'
```
Second, set the number of HMC chains that are to be run in parallel. We typically run 8 chains, but 2 or 4 can also be used as long as the number of HMC iterations below are adjusted:
```R
hmc_chains_n <- 8
```
Third, set the variable ```hpc.nproc.cmdstan``` which specifies how many CPU cores are used to generate one HMC chain. We recommend at least 4, and by default use as many CPU cores as states in the analysis:
```R
hpc.nproc.cmdstan <- n_countries
```
Fourth, set the number of HMC warmup step and total number of HMC iterations. Aim for 4000 to 5000 total samples after warmup across all HMC chains. For 8 HMC chains, the default choice is: 
```R
hmc_num_samples= 1500
hmc_num_warmup= 1000
```
Fifth, specify the Stan model that you wish to use, and a job tag that may contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. By default the Stan model is set to that used in the final version for publication:
```R
stanModelFile= 'covid19AgeModel_v120_cmdstanv'
```
			
Then, run the Rscript from a Terminal console:
```bash
$ cd covid19AgeModel/inst
$ Rscript make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-v120-bash.R
```
This will generate in the specified output directory one bash script for each HMC chain and the post-processing scripts. Execute these bash script one by one, or alternatively run them in the background,
```bash
$ cd out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag
$ ./startme-stanModelFile-job_tag-hmc1.sh 
```
where ```out_dir```, ```stanModelFile```, ```job_tag``` are specified above. 
When all the chains are finished, run the postprocessing of the central analysis with, 
```
$ ./out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag/post_processing_save_posterior_samples.sh
```
and the postprocessing of the schools counterfactual analysis with, 
```
$ ./out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag/post_processing_forecast_reopen_0_level_K12.sh
$ ./out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag/post_processing_forecast_reopen_1_school_counterfactual_0_multiplier_100_level_K12.sh
```
The HMC samples, figures and tables are stored in one folder:
```
out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag
```
An html report summarising the results of the central analysis is stored under:
```
report_dir/report_stanModelFile-job_tag.html
```
An html report summarising the results of the schools counterfactual analysis is stored under:
```
report_dir/report_forecast_stanModelFile-job_tag.html
```

Please note the full analysis on 40 US states or more is computationally intensive. The run time for 40 locations with 1500 iterations, including 1000 considered as warmup, is approximately 120 hours per chain, when one CPU is allocated to each chain. The age-specific outputs are also memory expensive, with approximately ~1TB memory for a full analysis on 40 US states or more with various forecast scenarios included.


## Usage: full analysis for 40 states, 8 HMC chains, high-throughput computing (as in the final version for publication)
Follow the above steps but use the Rscript
```bash
covid19AgeModel/inst/make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-v120-HPC.R
```
You will need to modify the PBS header function at the start of this Rscript:
```R
#	function to make PBS header
make.PBS.header <- function(hpc.walltime=47, hpc.select=1, hpc.nproc=1, hpc.mem= "6gb", hpc.load= "module load anaconda3/personal\nsource activate covid19AgeModel", hpc.q="pqcovid19c", hpc.array=1 )
{	
	pbshead <- "#!/bin/sh"
	tmp <- paste("#PBS -l walltime=", hpc.walltime, ":59:00", sep = "")
	pbshead <- paste(pbshead, tmp, sep = "\n")
	tmp <- paste("#PBS -l select=", hpc.select, ":ncpus=", hpc.nproc,":ompthreads=", hpc.nproc,":mem=", hpc.mem, sep = "")	
	pbshead <- paste(pbshead, tmp, sep = "\n")
	pbshead <- paste(pbshead, "#PBS -j oe", sep = "\n")
	if(hpc.array>1)
	{
		pbshead	<- paste(pbshead, "\n#PBS -J 1-", hpc.array, sep='')
	}				
	if(!is.na(hpc.q))
	{
		pbshead <- paste(pbshead, paste("#PBS -q", hpc.q), sep = "\n")
	}		
	pbshead	<- paste(pbshead, hpc.load, sep = "\n")
	pbshead
}
```

```
Lastly, the demo analysis is performed for 4 locations: Colorado, Connecticut, Florida and New York City. The selected locations can be changed using:
```R
countries <-  "CO,CT,FL,NYC"
```
Please be careful not to leave spaces between commas and locations' code.

Then, run the Rscript from the terminal console

```
Third, set the variable ```hpc.nproc.cmdstan``` which specifies how many CPU cores are used to generate one HMC chain. We recommend at least 4, and by default use as many CPU cores as states in the analysis:
```R
hpc.nproc.cmdstan <- n_countries
```
Fourth, set the number of HMC warmup step and total number of HMC iterations. Aim for 4000 to 5000 total samples after warmup across all HMC chains. For 8 HMC chains, the default choice is: 
```R
hmc_num_samples= 1500
hmc_num_warmup= 1000
```
Fifth, specify the Stan model that you wish to use, and a job tag that may contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. By default the Stan model is set to that used for Report 32:
```R
stanModelFile= 'covid19AgeModel_report32_cmdstanv'
job_tag= '37states_central_analysis'
```
Then, run the Rscript from a Terminal console:
```bash
$ cd covid19AgeModel/inst
$ Rscript make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-report32-bash.R
```
This will generate in the specified output directory one bash script for each HMC chain. Execute these bash script one by one, or alternatively run them in the background,
```bash
$ cd out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag
$ ./startme-stanModelFile-job_tag-hmc1.sh 
```
where ```out_dir```, ```stanModelFile```, ```job_tag``` are specified above. After all the HMC chains are completed, run the postprocessing with,  
```
out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag/postprocessing.sh
```
and the postprocessing of the schools counterfactual analysis with, 
```
$ ./out_dir/post_processing_forecast_reopen_0_multiplier_50.sh
$ ./out_dir/post_processing_forecast_reopen_1_multiplier_20.sh
$ ./out_dir/post_processing_forecast_reopen_1_multiplier_33.sh
$ ./out_dir/post_processing_forecast_reopen_1_multiplier_50.sh
$ ./out_dir/post_processing_forecast_reopen_1_multiplier_100.sh
```
The HMC samples, figures and tables are stored in one folder:
```
out_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag
```
An html report summarising the results is stored under:
```
report_dir/stanModelFile-job_tag-report.html
```
An html report summarising the results of the schools counterfactual analysis is stored under:
```
report_dir/report_forecast_stanModelFile-job_tag.html
```

Please note the full analysis on 37 US states or more is computationally intensive. The run time for 37 locations with 1500 iterations, including 1000 considered as warmup, is approximately 48 hours per chain, when one CPU is allocated to each chain. The age-specific outputs are also memory expensive, with approximately ~1TB memory for a full analysis on 37 US states or more with various forecast scenarios included.


## Usage: full analysis for 37 states, 8 HMC chains, high-throughput computing (as in Imperial Report 32 v1)
Follow the above steps but use the Rscript
```bash
covid19AgeModel/inst/make-analysis-covid19AgeModel-report32-HPC.R
```
You will need to modify the PBS header function at the start of this Rscript:
```R
#	function to make PBS header
make.PBS.header <- function(hpc.walltime=47, hpc.select=1, hpc.nproc=1, hpc.mem= "6gb", hpc.load= "module load anaconda3/personal\nsource activate covid19AgeModel", hpc.q="pqcovid19c", hpc.array=1 )
{	
	pbshead <- "#!/bin/sh"
	tmp <- paste("#PBS -l walltime=", hpc.walltime, ":59:00", sep = "")
	pbshead <- paste(pbshead, tmp, sep = "\n")
	tmp <- paste("#PBS -l select=", hpc.select, ":ncpus=", hpc.nproc,":ompthreads=", hpc.nproc,":mem=", hpc.mem, sep = "")	
	pbshead <- paste(pbshead, tmp, sep = "\n")
	pbshead <- paste(pbshead, "#PBS -j oe", sep = "\n")
	if(hpc.array>1)
	{
		pbshead	<- paste(pbshead, "\n#PBS -J 1-", hpc.array, sep='')
	}				
	if(!is.na(hpc.q))
	{
		pbshead <- paste(pbshead, paste("#PBS -q", hpc.q), sep = "\n")
	}		
	pbshead	<- paste(pbshead, hpc.load, sep = "\n")
	pbshead
}
```
